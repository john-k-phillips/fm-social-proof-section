<h3>What I Learnt</h3>
  <p>
    Creating the background images for both mobile and desktop is I usually skip due to lack of knowledge.
    I recently picked up on a few tips and tricks and decided to give it a shot, I was happy with the results.
  </p>
<h3>Continued Development</h3>
  <p>
    I am satisfied with the finish project and wouldn't continue development.
